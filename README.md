# 30_Days_of_Python
This is just my progress and solutions developed while attempting to complete the 30 days of python via github. 
This repository includes all of the files and what I have attempted so far, it will be constantly updated until I do complete it.
Some answers I did look for guidance when I felt it was needed. There is a 30 Days of Python solutions repository for others in need. 
Feel free to reach out for criticism, and better ways and or solutions to what I have been doing. By no means am I an expert, but I will be
trying to become one. 

Happy Programming! Do not stop!
